# VMC
Variational Monte Carlo

In the project, I use ["VMC"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Monte_Carlo) to calculate the ground state
energy of He atom and n-number of bosonic particles in m dimensions.


## Note
I use bitbucket for the version control as It provides free private repositories. If you want to get full development-history for this code, please email me on mail02ankit@gmail.com.
